Bouncing DVD logo screensaver for MSX-DOS. Compiled with SJASM.


(Optionally) add to MultiMente:
* Copy the file DVD.COM to the MM directory
* Editing the MM.CFG file and look for the SCSAVER param
* Change it so the line looks like this: SCSAVER = DVD.COM
* If you want to see the result quickly, also change the SC_TIME = 30 to a smaller value. SC_TIME = 1, for example, would make the screensaver appear in 4.2 sec.
